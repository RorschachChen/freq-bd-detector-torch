# Rethinking the Backdoor Attacks' Triggers: A Frequency Perspective
This is the unofficial pytorch implementation of the ICCV paper: 'Rethinking the Backdoor Attacks' Triggers: A Frequency Perspective .' 

This implementation includes: 1) a sample of developing a supervised backdoored data detector in the frequency domain, which achieves an averaging 98.50% detection rate under attack and model agnostic settings over eight different backdoor attacks.
